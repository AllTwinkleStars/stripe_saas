#### The Meteor Chef
#### \#005 - Building a SaaS with Meteor: Stripe

In this recipe (two parts) we'll help a new SaaS startup Todoodle (a todo list creator) integrate Stripe into their app. We'll learn about signing up users, creating customers and subscriptions in stripe, managing a customer's usage,  and displaying a customer's  current plan information.

In part two of our Stripe recipe we'll learn how to make it possible for our customers to change their plan, update and add new credit cards, cancel a subscription, and resubscribe to a subscription. We'll also learn about using Stripe's webhooks to display invoices for our customers and control account status.
